# React Chart libraries

## What are React chart libraries?
React chart libraries, or React apps, are software development tools web developers use to integrate data visuals in their projects. The libraries manage the data presentation and aesthetics of the visuals so that developers can focus on producing and maintaining the data itself. React chart libraries are versatile and scalable apps that are highly functional and require coding to add to your project.

## Benefits of React chart libraries:
