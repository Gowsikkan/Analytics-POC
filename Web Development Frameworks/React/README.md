# React Chart libraries

## What are React chart libraries?
React chart libraries, or React apps, are software development tools web developers use to integrate data visuals in their projects. The libraries manage the data presentation and aesthetics of the visuals so that developers can focus on producing and maintaining the data itself. React chart libraries are versatile and scalable apps that are highly functional and require coding to add to your project.

## Benefits of React chart libraries:
- React chart libraries are a great tool to add interactive charts and support animation.
- They include built-in support for zooming, panning, exporting charts as images, drill-down data, and real-time updates.
- Any type of chart is supported from simple bar charts to complex charts like range charts, stock charts, stacked charts, hexagon heat maps, contour plots, scatterplots, hexagon heatmaps, etc.
- You can add hundreds of thousands of data points into your chart displays to show beautiful summaries of complex data.
