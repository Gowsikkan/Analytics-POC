# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation of Node.js on Windows

Step-1: Downloading the Node.js ‘.msi’ installer. [Link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 

Step-2: An MSI installer will be downloaded on your system. Double click the node installer and accpet all the tearms and conditions and click install. 

Step-3: After installation is complete click finish 

Step-4: To verify that node.js was properly installed or not open your command promt and test it
### ```node -v ``` 

This command prompt will print the version of the node.js installed. 

Step-5: Run the following command, to quickly update the npm 
### ```npm install npm –global ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

Step-1: Open the terminal and move to the current directory 

Step-2: Run the following command to install react scripts 

### ```npm install react-scripts --save```

Step-3: Start you react app using the following command 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
