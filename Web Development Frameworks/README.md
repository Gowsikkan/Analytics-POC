# Web Development Frameworks

## What is a Framework?
A software framework is built on top of a programming language. For example, Rails, also known as Ruby on Rails, is a web framework built on top of the Ruby programming language. Django and Flask are two different web frameworks built on top of the Python programming language. The purpose of a framework is to assist in development, providing standard, low-level functionality so that developers can focus efforts on the elements that make the project unique

## React
React is an open source JavaScript framework, that isn't actually a framework. But it is currently the most commonly used front-end development technology in the world. React, originally developed by and still maintained by Facebook and supported by an active open source community, is in fact a JS 'library'

### Pros
•	Easy to Learn and Use
•	Creating Dynamic Web Applications Becomes Easier.
•	Reusable Components. 
•	Performance Enhancement.
•	The Support of Handy Tools.
•	Known to be SEO Friendly
•	The Benefit of Having JavaScript Library. 
•	Scope for Testing the Codes.

### Cons
1. The high pace of development
The high pace of development has an advantage and disadvantage both. In case of disadvantage, since the environment continually changes so fast, some of the developers not feeling comfortable to relearn the new ways of doing things regularly. It may be hard for them to adopt all these changes with all the continuous updates. They need to be always updated with their skills and learn new ways of doing things.
2. Poor Documentation
It is another cons which are common for constantly updating technologies. React technologies updating and accelerating so fast that there is no time to make proper documentation. To overcome this, developers write instructions on their own with the evolving of new releases and tools in their current projects.
3. View Part
ReactJS covers only the UI Layers of the app and nothing else. So you still need to choose some other technologies to get a complete tooling set for development in the project.
4. JSX as a barrier
ReactJS uses JSX. It's a syntax extension that allows HTML with JavaScript mixed together. This approach has its own benefits, but some members of the development community consider JSX as a barrier, especially for new developers. Developers complain about its complexity in the learning curve.

## Angular
Angular is a development platform, built on TypeScript. As a platform, Angular includes:
•	A component-based framework for building scalable web applications
•	A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more
•	A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code


### Pros
•	Functionality out of the box. The default setup of Angular gives you everything you need, right out of the box.
•	TypeScript. Angular is built with TypeScript. 
•	Consistency. 
•	Productivity. 
•	Maintainability.
•	Modular development structure.
•	Angular Material.

### Cons
•	One of the major drawbacks to using Angular is the platform's limited SEO options and poor accessibility for search engine crawlers.
•	Another glaring con of using the Angular framework is that it can be quite difficult to learn.

## Vue
VueJS is an open source progressive JavaScript framework used to develop interactive web interfaces. It is one of the famous frameworks used to simplify web development. VueJS focusses on the view layer. It can be easily integrated into big projects for front-end development without any issues.

### Pros
•	Lightweight
•	User-friendly
•	Beginner-friendly
•	Reusable
•	Ease of use
•	Virtual DOM
•	Segregation
•	Integration
•	Compatibility
•	Customization

### Cons
•	Limitations in making use of the community
•	Lack of scalability; Lack of plugins
•	Lack of highly experienced experts 
•	Difficulties with mobile support
•	Difficulties with two-way binding 
•	Excessive code flexibility

## Svelte
Svelte is a modern JavaScript framework used to build static web apps that are fast, lean, and are fun for developers to use. You can use Svelte to build single, reusable components for projects of any kind, including larger applications written with Angular, React, Vue, or any other frameworks.

### Pros
•	Easy to learn. Svelte is easy to learn.
•	Syntax and semantics. 
•	Write less code. 
•	Compilers enable output flexibility.
•	Great performance. 
•	Feels good.  
•	Aligns with the web platform. 
•	Compilers move complexity.

### Cons
•	Small community. If you're a new developer you should be very careful when committing to a long term project in Svelte.
•	No cross-platform support. If you need a cross-platform application then Svelte is not the best choice.
•	Not many job opportunities.

## Solid
SolidJS is a declarative UI library for building web applications, much like React, Angular, or Vue. It is built using brutally efficient fine-grained reactivity(No Virtual DOM), an ephemeral component model, and the full expressiveness of JavaScript(TypeScript) and JSX.

### Pros
•	Real DOM with fine-grained updates.
•	Declarative data.
•	Fast
•	Supports and is built on TypeScript.
•	Supports modern features like JSX, Fragments, Context, Portals, Suspense, Streaming SSR, Progressive Hydration, Error Boundaries and Concurrent Rendering.
